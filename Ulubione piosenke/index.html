    <p class="lyrics">[Verse 1]<br>
      Sure, it's a calming notion, perpetual in motion<br>
      But I don't need the comfort of any lies<br>
      For I have seen the ending and there is no ascending rise<br>
      Oh, back when I was younger, was told by other youngsters<br>
      That my end will be torture beneath the earth<br>
      'Cause I don't see what they see when death is staring at me<br>
      I see a window, a limit, to live it, or not at all

<p class="lyrics">  [Chorus]
    I'm going back to 505
If it's a 7-hour flight or a 45-minute drive
In my imagination you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

Stop and wait a sec
Oh when you look at me like that my darling
What did you expect?
I'd probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
Or I did last time I checked

Not shy of a spark
A knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark
Frightened by the bite though it's no harsher than the bark
Middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start

I'm going back to 505
If it's a 7-hour flight or a 45-minute drive
In my imagination you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

But I crumble completely when you cry
It seems like once again you've had to greet me with "Goodbye"
I'm always just about to go and spoil a surprise
Take my hands off of your eyes too soon

I'm going back to 505
If it's a 7-hour flight or a 45-minute drive
In my imagination you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

...and a smile

      <p class="lyrics">[Verse 1]
        Show me how you care
        Tell me how you loved before
        Show me how you smile
        Tell me why your hands are cold
        
        [Pre-Chorus]
        Show me how
        
        [Chorus]
        I'm turning around, I'm having visions of you
        But then I understand
        The friend I'm dreaming of is far away
        But I'm here, I'm here
        
        [Verse 2]
        Show me how you're proud
        Tell me how you reach the moon
        My thoughts err away tonight
        My heart fell to love again
        
        [Pre-Chorus]
        Show me how
        
        [Chorus]
        I'm turning around, I'm having visions of you
        But then I understand
        The friend I'm dreaming of is far away
        And doesn't feel my lo</p>
