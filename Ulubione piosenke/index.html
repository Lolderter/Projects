        Sure, it's a calming notion, perpetual in motion
        But I don't need the comfort of any lies
        For I have seen the ending and there is no ascending rise
        Oh, back when I was younger, was told by other youngsters
        That my end will be torture beneath the earth
        'Cause I don't see what they see when death is staring at me
        I see a window, a limit, to live it, or not at all</p>
